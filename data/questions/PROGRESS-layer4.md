Tracking revision of questions to sentence stem format with conversational answers.

## Pattern Reference

See `GUIDE-layer3.md` for the full writing guide (applies to all layers with adjustment for layer-specific spectrum).

**Layer 4 Definition**: Do what needs doing, especially when you don't feel like it.

**Answer Progression (1→5)**:
| Score | Posture |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Passive / External — not doing it, or no structure |
| 2 | Mostly External — trying but consistently failing |
| 3 | Split / Honest Middle — inconsistent, depends on feelings |
| 4 | Mostly Owned — usually disciplined, with honest hedge |
| 5 | Fully Owned — discipline is non-negotiable |

## Notes for Future Layers

### For D5 (Mind at Skill)

**Thinking progression model** (discovered during D4 revision):
- L1: Accept without filter
- L2: Accept if source credible (external filter)
- L3: Form own view, evolves frequently (internal but unstable)
- L4: Weigh against what I know, update if better (critical)
- L5: Use as raw material for original thinking (generative)

**Engagement posture model** (also from D4):
- Pre-judged: "already know they're wrong"
- Negative filter: "look for how they're wrong"
- Positive filter: "look for what I can learn"
- Active pursuit: "seek them out"

### General Pattern Refinements (from Layer 4 session)

- Stem + answer must form readable sentence
- Use their internal narrative, not your diagnosis
  - ✓ "push them down — if they're important I'll deal with them later"
  - ✗ "push them down until they come out sideways"
- "reasons" not "excuses" (what they call it)
- "until I crash" not "until it's too late" (concrete behavior)
- "always on the list, never on the calendar" — honest self-talk
- "find the reasons why it was not my fault" — their framing
