# Quickstart: Continuing Question Revision

## Prompt for New Chat

```
I'm working on a Wheel of Life assessment tool. The repo is jeremiahstover/wheel_of_life.

We're revising 360 questions across 8 layers × 9 dimensions. Layers 3 and 4 are complete (90 questions). We're continuing with the remaining layers.

Before we start:
1. Read data/questions/GUIDE.md — the master pattern guide
2. Read data/questions/WORKFLOW.md — the process we follow
3. Check which PROGRESS-*.md files exist to see status

Then let's continue with Layer [X]. We go cell by cell (A, B, C... I), question by question. You propose, I refine. We iterate until each question is right, then commit and move on.

Key context:
- These questions must enable honest self-assessment (not trigger defensiveness)
- Sentence stems, not agree/disagree
- Answers describe behavior, not labels
- Each layer has its own spectrum (see GUIDE.md)
- Every question is load-bearing — we can't afford throwaway questions

Let's start.

## What the New Chat Will Need to Discover

Even with this, some things will need to be re-learned:

- **The exact right "tone" for your audience** — Christian context, but avoiding religious performance pressure
- **Specific vocabulary preferences** — You'll catch words that feel off (e.g., "excuses" → "reasons", "honestly" triggers dishonesty)
- **The rhythm of iteration** — When to push back vs accept "good enough"

The core patterns and workflow are documented. The nuance comes through collaboration.
