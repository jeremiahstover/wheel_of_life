# Answer Writing Guide

Guidelines for writing conversational answer text for assessment questions.

*Originally developed for Layer 3 (Responsibility), now applies to all layers with layer-specific adjustments.*

---

## Core Principle

**Make honest self-assessment easy.** People avoid answers that make them feel judged. Describe *behavior*, not character flaws.

---

## Question Text

### 1. Avoid "correct answer" framing

The question shouldn't telegraph which answer is "right."

- ❌ "I don't blame my upbringing for my spiritual state"
- ✓ "My upbringing, church experiences, and circumstances have created who I am today"

The second makes the low-responsibility answer easier to honestly select.

### 2. Sentence stems invite projection

Open-ended completion reveals more than agree/disagree.

- ❌ "I recognize that spiritual growth requires my active participation"
- ✓ "My spiritual growth depends on ..."

### 3. Avoid preachy or loaded language

Words like "blame," "excuse," "should" trigger defensiveness. Describe the behavior instead.

- ❌ "I blame circumstances"
- ✓ "I look for a new church, group, or environment to fix it"

Same behavior, no judgment word.

### 4. Watch for jargon and connotations

Words carry baggage in specific contexts. Use neutral language where possible.

## Answer Progression (1→5)

| Score | Posture | Key Characteristics |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | Passive / External | Someone or something else is responsible; waiting for change to happen to me |
| 2 | Mostly External | Heavy reliance on others/circumstances; minimal personal agency |
| 3 | Split / Honest Middle | "Both/and" — acknowledges responsibility but still leans on externals |
| 4 | Mostly Owned | Takes responsibility but with an honest hedge or imperfection |
| 5 | Fully Owned | Clean ownership, no excuses, no hedging |

---

## Writing Rules

### 1. Describe behavior, not labels

- ❌ "I'm irresponsible about spiritual time"
- ✓ "Almost anything bumps my time with God — it's first to go when life gets full"

### 2. Answer 1 is passive/victim without being cartoonish

Should feel like something a real person would say.

- ✓ "My spiritual state makes sense when you consider what I've been through"

### 3. Answer 3 is the honest middle ground

Acknowledges both sides without being wishy-washy.

- ✓ "I take some responsibility, but the past needs to carry some as well"

### 4. Answer 4 is real imperfection, not a cop-out

Owns it but admits a genuine struggle. Often the most relatable answer.

- ✓ "The past shaped me, but my choices shape me more"
- ✓ "...but I sometimes get in my own way"

### 5. Answer 5 is clean — no hedging

No "but," no qualifiers.

- ✓ "Whatever happened before, what I do with it now is all mine"

### 6. Each answer should be clearly distinct from adjacent ones

- If 4 encroaches on 5's space, reword
- If 2 and 3 blur together, sharpen the distinction

### 7. Flow should be smooth

Read 1→5 as a progression. Should feel like a spectrum, not random statements.

## Anti-patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "Blame" language | Triggers defensiveness | Describe the behavior instead |
| Self-referencing answers | "I know I should but..." references the "right" answer | State position directly |
| Questions with obvious correct answer | Hard to answer honestly | Flip framing to make low scores easier to admit |
| Defining words with themselves | "Responsibility is being responsible" | Use concrete descriptions |
| Hedging in the 5 answer | Muddies the top | Keep it clean |

---

## Layer 3 Specific Notes

Responsibility is about **ownership** — who/what gets credit or blame for your current state and future trajectory.

The spectrum runs from:
- **External locus** (1): Life happens to me
- **Internal locus** (5): I happen to life

Key behaviors to probe:
- Where do you look first when things aren't working? (Self vs. circumstances)
- What gets protected vs. displaced when life gets full?
- How do you frame your past? (Explanation vs. excuse)
- Who/what do you wait on before acting?

---

*This guide may need adjustment for other layers. Each layer has its own ownership spectrum.*

---

## Why Quality Matters

The diagnostic uses ~45 questions instead of 360. Each question carries 8x more weight.

A question that:
- Triggers defensiveness → gets an inflated score
- Is misunderstood → gives false signal
- Has unclear distinctions between answers → adds noise

...can send the algorithm down the wrong branch and misidentify the break point.

**Every question is load-bearing. No throwaway questions.**


---

## Readable Concatenation

Stem + answer must form a grammatically correct sentence.

- ✓ "My learning is ... intentional — I learn what I need for what I'm building"
- ✗ "My learning is ... I have a regular practice of reading"

Test by reading the stem and answer together out loud.

---

## Internal Narrative vs Diagnosis

Use what they actually tell themselves, not your analysis of their behavior.

- ✓ "push them down — if they're important I'll deal with them later" (their self-talk)
- ✗ "push them down until they come out sideways" (your diagnosis)

- ✓ "find the reasons why it was not my fault" (their framing)
- ✗ "make excuses" (your label)

- ✓ "skip it and plan to make up for it later" (what they think)
- ✗ "skip it and plan to make up for it later (I don't)" (your editorial)

The parenthetical diagnosis is you editorializing. Let the answer stand on its own.

---

## Layer-Specific Spectrums

Each layer has its own spectrum. The answer progression (1→5) must fit the layer's nature.

| Layer | Definition | Opposite | Spectrum (1→5) |
|-------|------------|----------|----------------|
| 1 - Order | Arrangement displaying relationship between elements | Nihilism | Chaos → Some awareness → Inconsistent application → Usually ordered → Order is foundational |
| 2 - Causality | Relationship between cause and effect | Fatalism | Things happen to me → Vague sense of connection → See some links → Usually connect actions to outcomes → Causal thinking informs all decisions |
| 3 - Responsibility | Duty to deal with something | Entitlement | External locus → Mostly external → Split → Mostly owned → Internal locus |
| 4 - Discipline | Controlled, habitual training | Hedonism | Not doing → Trying but failing → Inconsistent → Usually → Non-negotiable |
| 5 - Skill | Ability to do something well | Incompetence | Can't do it → Struggling → Competent but inconsistent → Proficient → Mastery |
| 6 - Resources | Produce of skill (money, time, relationships) | Poverty | Depleted/no margin → Occasional surplus → Some margin → Usually have margin → Abundant, actively stewarding |
| 7 - Fellowship | Mutual investment, transparency, sharpening | Isolation/Pride | Isolated → Surface only → Some depth but guarded → Usually open → Deep mutual sharpening |
| 8 - Sacrifice | Benefit others freely, no expectation of return | Hoarding | Self-focused → Give when convenient → Give from surplus → Generous with limits → Pour out freely |

---

## Discipline vs Skill Distinction

These are easy to confuse. The key question:

- **Discipline (Layer 4)**: Do you do it at all? Do you show up?
- **Skill (Layer 5)**: How well do you do it? What's your capability?

If a question is about *quality* or *capability*, it belongs at Skill, not Discipline.

Example:
- "Do you set aside time to think?" → Discipline (whether you do it)
- "What kind of thinking can you do?" → Skill (how well you do it)
---

## Advanced Patterns (from refinement)

### Answer 1 can be dismissive, not just passive

- ✓ "why would I follow through on that?" (dismissive)
- ~ "something got in the way" (passive)

Dismissive is often more honest — it reveals the underlying attitude.

### Answer 3 can acknowledge the trade-off

- ✓ "what I get from it feels worth it in the moment"
- ✓ "life happened, I should have pushed harder"

Honest about the payoff or the gap — not yet owning choice fully.

### Answer 4 hedges should be internal, not external

- ✓ "I messed up, I will try a little harder next time" (weak commitment)
- ✓ "though I usually drag my feet" (internal slowness)
- ✗ "though the obstacles were real" (external excuse)

The hedge is about imperfect execution, not blame-shifting.

### Answer 5 can be stark

- ✓ "I did not keep my word"
- ✓ "on me"
- ✓ "my choice"

No elaboration needed. Clean ownership.

### Relationship framing

Sometimes the question isn't "do I act?" but "how do I relate to?"

- Body: hostility → burden → ambivalence → care → value
- Responsibility: denial → avoidance → partial → owned → embraced

### "Getting caught" vs "accountability"

- ✓ "wait to see if anyone else noticed" (honest)
- ~ "wait for someone to hold me accountable" (sanitized)

The first reveals avoidance; the second sounds almost virtuous.

### Behavior over labels

Show what they actually do, not what they call it:

- ✓ "look for a new church, group, or environment to fix it"
- ✗ "blame my circumstances"
