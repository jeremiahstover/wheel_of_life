## SPIRIT (God-facing)

### Communion (Dimension 1 — Receives)

> *"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."* — Matthew 6:33

1. When my alarm goes off for morning prayer/devotion time, I get up and do it even when I don't feel like it.
2. I have a specific, scheduled time for prayer and Scripture reading that I protect from other demands.
3. When I miss a day of spiritual disciplines, I return to them the next day without spiraling into guilt or giving up.
4. I practice Sabbath rest intentionally, even when there's work I could be doing.
5. I follow through on spiritual commitments (church attendance, small group, serving) even when inconvenient.

**If struggling**: Start with the smallest viable spiritual habit. 5 minutes of prayer before checking your phone. Build consistency before duration.

---

### Conscience (Dimension 2 — Executes)

> *"So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."* — James 4:17

1. When I sense conviction about something (right or wrong), I act on it promptly rather than rationalizing or delaying.
2. I confess and make things right quickly when I've wronged someone, even when it's uncomfortable.
3. I say 'no' to requests or opportunities that violate my values, even when saying yes would benefit me.
4. I keep my word and follow through on commitments, even small ones, even when no one would notice if I didn't.
5. When I notice I'm justifying questionable behavior, I stop and examine myself honestly.

**If struggling**: "Tell the truth, or at least don't lie." Every rationalization weakens your conscience; every honest act strengthens it.

---

### Holiness (Dimension 3 — State)

> *"As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct."* — 1 Peter 1:14-15

1. When the Holy Spirit convicts me of sin, I confess and repent promptly rather than rationalizing, minimizing, or delaying.
2. I maintain spiritual disciplines even during dry seasons when I don't feel God's presence or see spiritual fruit.
3. I actively work to root out areas of habitual sin or compromise rather than tolerating them as 'just how I am.'
4. I intentionally seek spiritual filling and renewal (worship, solitude, prayer) rather than running on empty until I crash.
5. I maintain my commitment to holiness in private — when no one would know if I compromised.

**If struggling**: Holiness isn't perfection — it's direction. Identify ONE area of compromise you've been tolerating. Confess it. Make a plan to address it.

---

## SOUL (Self-facing)

### Mind (Dimension 4 — Receives)

> *"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."* — Romans 12:2

1. I have a consistent practice of reading/learning (books, courses, study) that I maintain even when busy.
2. I engage in deep thinking (reflection, journaling, analysis) rather than only consuming content passively.
3. I protect focused thinking time from interruptions and distractions (phone, notifications, multitasking).
4. When I encounter ideas that challenge my thinking, I engage with them honestly rather than dismissing them.
5. I apply what I learn (wisdom) rather than just accumulating knowledge I never use.

**If struggling**: Start with 15 minutes of reading daily. But don't just read—apply one thing from everything you learn.

---

### Will (Dimension 5 — Executes)

> *"For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control."* — 2 Timothy 1:7

1. When I commit to doing something (to myself or others), I follow through even when it becomes inconvenient.
2. I do hard things I don't want to do because they need to be done, without excessive internal negotiation.
3. I make decisions and act on them rather than staying stuck in analysis or procrastination.
4. When I fail to follow through, I examine why, make adjustments, and try again rather than making excuses.
5. I build small disciplines in daily life (bed made, dishes done, space organized) that strengthen my overall will.

**If struggling**: "Start by cleaning your room." Pick one tiny discipline and make it non-negotiable for 30 days.

---

### Emotions (Dimension 6 — State)

> *"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger."* — Ephesians 4:26

1. I feel the full range of emotions throughout the day without those emotions dictating my actions.
2. I process difficult emotions (journaling, talking, praying) rather than burying or numbing them.
3. I pause before responding when emotionally triggered rather than reacting impulsively.
4. I have healthy outlets for stress and negative emotions rather than destructive coping mechanisms.
5. I address emotional issues in relationships directly rather than letting resentment build or avoiding conflict.

**If struggling**: When triggered, name the emotion out loud ("I'm feeling angry"), take three breaths, then choose your response. Emotions are data, not directives.

---

## BODY (World-facing)

### Sustenance (Dimension 7 — Receives)

> *"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?"* — 1 Corinthians 6:19

1. I maintain a consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime and wake time) even on weekends.
2. I eat in a way that fuels my body well (real food, appropriate portions) rather than giving in to cravings.
3. I drink adequate water throughout the day and limit substances that impair performance (alcohol, excessive caffeine).
4. I maintain my environment (clean space, organized workspace, reduced toxins/clutter) rather than living in chaos.
5. I take breaks and rest when needed rather than pushing through to burnout, then crashing.

**If struggling**: Start with sleep. Set a non-negotiable bedtime for one week. Everything else becomes harder when you're tired.

---

### Capability (Dimension 8 — Executes)

> *"For while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way."* — 1 Timothy 4:8

1. I exercise regularly according to a schedule rather than only when I feel like it.
2. I do my planned workout even when I don't feel motivated, knowing motivation follows action.
3. I incorporate movement throughout my day (standing, walking, stretching) rather than being sedentary for long periods.
4. I progressively challenge my body (increased weight, distance, intensity) rather than staying in my comfort zone.
5. I maintain my exercise habit even during travel, busy seasons, or disrupted routines.

**If struggling**: Start with something so small it's embarrassing: 5 pushups. 10-minute walk. The goal is building the discipline, not the fitness.

---

### Wholeness (Dimension 9 — State)

> *"Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul."* — 3 John 1:2

1. I schedule and attend regular preventive care (checkups, dental, vision) rather than only going when something is wrong.
2. When I notice a health issue (pain, symptom, concern), I address it promptly rather than ignoring it.
3. I follow through on medical recommendations (medication, therapy, lifestyle changes) even when inconvenient.
4. I manage chronic conditions or health maintenance routines consistently rather than sporadically.
5. I recognize that physical, mental, and spiritual health are connected and address my body as an integrated whole.

**If struggling**: What have you been avoiding? Schedule one appointment this week that you've been putting off.

## Scoring

### Per Dimension
1. Sum the 5 question scores (5-25)
2. Divide by 5 (average: 1-5)
3. Multiply by 2 (dimension score: 2-10)

### Interpretation

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1-2 | Crisis | Immediate attention required |
| 3-4 | Below Baseline | Needs focused work |
| 5-6 | Maintaining | Functional but not growing |
| 7-8 | Target Zone | Disciplines established |
| 9-10 | Exceptional | Approaching mastery |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Identify crisis areas** (1-4) for immediate intervention
2. **Choose 2-3 focus areas** for this season's growth
3. **Implement ONE small discipline** improvement per focus area
4. **Review weekly**, adjust monthly
5. **Re-assess quarterly**

### The Remediation Principle

If Discipline is weak, shore up Responsibility (are you taking ownership?).
Go down the layers until you find solid ground:

```
Discipline ← Responsibility ← Causality ← Order
```

## Visual: The Wheel

```
                 Communion (1)
                      |
         Holiness (3) |  Conscience (2)
              \       |       /
               \      |      /
  Wholeness (9)--\----|-----/--Mind (4)
                  \   |    /
                   \  |   /
  Capability (8)----\-|--/----Will (5)
                     \|/
       Sustenance (7)-+-Emotions (6)
```

Plot each score (1-10) on its spoke. Connect the dots.

- **Balanced wheel** = sustainable life
- **Spiky wheel** = strengths but also crisis areas
- **Small wheel** = overall discipline gap
- **Lopsided wheel** = neglected domains

---

*"No dimension exists in isolation. Spirit, Soul, and Body affect each other. Neglect in one area will eventually impact others."*
