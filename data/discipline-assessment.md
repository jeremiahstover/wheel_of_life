# Wheel of Life Assessment: Discipline Layer

**Purpose**: Assess how consistently you execute in each of the 9 dimensions of life.

**Definition of Discipline**: Consistently making yourself do what needs to be done, especially when you don't feel like doing it.

**Scoring**: Each question uses a 1-5 scale. Average per dimension, multiply by 2 for 1-10 wheel score.

## SPIRIT

### Connection to God (Dimension 1)

> *"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."* — Matthew 6:33

1. When my alarm goes off for morning prayer/devotion time, I get up and do it even when I don't feel like it.
2. I have a specific, scheduled time for prayer and Scripture reading that I protect from other demands.
3. When I miss a day of spiritual disciplines, I return to them the next day without spiraling into guilt or giving up.
4. I practice Sabbath rest intentionally, even when there's work I could be doing.
5. I follow through on spiritual commitments (church attendance, small group, serving) even when inconvenient.

**If struggling**: Start with the smallest viable spiritual habit. 5 minutes of prayer before checking your phone. Build consistency before duration.

---

### Conscience (Dimension 2)

> *"So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."* — James 4:17

1. When I sense conviction about something (right or wrong), I act on it promptly rather than rationalizing or delaying.
2. I confess and make things right quickly when I've wronged someone, even when it's uncomfortable.
3. I say 'no' to requests or opportunities that violate my values, even when saying yes would benefit me.
4. I keep my word and follow through on commitments, even small ones, even when no one would notice if I didn't.
5. When I notice I'm justifying questionable behavior, I stop and examine myself honestly.

**If struggling**: Jordan Peterson's rule: "Tell the truth, or at least don't lie." Every rationalization weakens your conscience; every honest act strengthens it.

---

### Purpose/Calling (Dimension 3)

> *"I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."* — Philippians 3:14

1. I regularly evaluate opportunities against my calling and say no to good things that aren't my things.
2. When I feel purposeless or directionless, I take specific action to seek clarity rather than just drifting.
3. I spend time on work that aligns with my calling even when more urgent (but less important) tasks compete for attention.
4. I regularly review my life direction (annually, quarterly) and make adjustments to stay on course.
5. I persist in my calling even during seasons when the results aren't visible or the work isn't rewarding.

**If struggling**: Write one sentence answering: "What am I made for?" Then evaluate this week's calendar against that sentence.

---

## SOUL

### Mind (Dimension 4)

> *"Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."* — Romans 12:2

1. I have a consistent practice of reading/learning (books, courses, study) that I maintain even when busy.
2. I engage in deep thinking (reflection, journaling, analysis) rather than only consuming content passively.
3. I protect focused thinking time from interruptions and distractions (phone, notifications, multitasking).
4. When I encounter ideas that challenge my thinking, I engage with them honestly rather than dismissing them.
5. I apply what I learn (wisdom) rather than just accumulating knowledge I never use.

**If struggling**: Start with 15 minutes of reading daily. But don't just read—apply one thing from everything you learn.

---

### Will (Dimension 5)

> *"For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control."* — 2 Timothy 1:7

1. When I commit to doing something (to myself or others), I follow through even when it becomes inconvenient.
2. I do hard things I don't want to do because they need to be done, without excessive internal negotiation.
3. I make decisions and act on them rather than staying stuck in analysis or procrastination.
4. When I fail to follow through, I examine why, make adjustments, and try again rather than making excuses.
5. I build small disciplines in daily life (bed made, dishes done, space organized) that strengthen my overall will.

**If struggling**: Jordan Peterson: "Start by cleaning your room." Pick one tiny discipline and make it non-negotiable for 30 days.

---

### Emotions (Dimension 6)

> *"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger."* — Ephesians 4:26

1. I feel the full range of emotions throughout the day without those emotions dictating my actions.
2. I process difficult emotions (journaling, talking, praying) rather than burying or numbing them.
3. I pause before responding when emotionally triggered rather than reacting impulsively.
4. I have healthy outlets for stress and negative emotions rather than destructive coping mechanisms.
5. I address emotional issues in relationships directly rather than letting resentment build or avoiding conflict.

**If struggling**: When triggered, name the emotion out loud ("I'm feeling angry"), take three breaths, then choose your response. Emotions are data, not directives.

---

## BODY

### Fuel & Recovery (Dimension 7)

> *"Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?"* — 1 Corinthians 6:19

1. I maintain a consistent sleep schedule (same bedtime and wake time) even on weekends.
2. I eat in a way that fuels my body well (real food, appropriate portions) rather than giving in to cravings.
3. I drink adequate water throughout the day and limit substances that impair performance (alcohol, excessive caffeine).
4. I maintain my environment (clean space, organized workspace, reduced toxins/clutter) rather than living in chaos.
5. I take breaks and rest when needed rather than pushing through to burnout, then crashing.

**If struggling**: Start with sleep. Set a non-negotiable bedtime for one week. Everything else becomes harder when you're tired.

---

### Capacity & Function (Dimension 8)

> *"For while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way."* — 1 Timothy 4:8

1. I exercise regularly according to a schedule rather than only when I feel like it.
2. I do my planned workout even when I don't feel motivated, knowing motivation follows action.
3. I incorporate movement throughout my day (standing, walking, stretching) rather than being sedentary for long periods.
4. I progressively challenge my body (increased weight, distance, intensity) rather than staying in my comfort zone.
5. I maintain my exercise habit even during travel, busy seasons, or disrupted routines.

**If struggling**: Start with something so small it's embarrassing: 5 pushups. 10-minute walk. The goal is building the discipline, not the fitness.

---

### Health & Wholeness (Dimension 9)

> *"Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul."* — 3 John 1:2

1. I schedule and attend regular preventive care (checkups, dental, vision) rather than only going when something is wrong.
2. When I notice a health issue (pain, symptom, concern), I address it promptly rather than ignoring it.
3. I follow through on medical recommendations (medication, therapy, lifestyle changes) even when inconvenient.
4. I manage chronic conditions or health maintenance routines consistently rather than sporadically.
5. I recognize that physical, mental, and spiritual health are connected and address my body as an integrated whole.

**If struggling**: What have you been avoiding? Schedule one appointment this week that you've been putting off.

## Scoring

### Per Dimension
1. Sum the 5 question scores (5-25)
2. Divide by 5 (average: 1-5)
3. Multiply by 2 (dimension score: 2-10)

### Interpretation

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1-2 | Crisis | Immediate attention required |
| 3-4 | Below Baseline | Needs focused work |
| 5-6 | Maintaining | Functional but not growing |
| 7-8 | Target Zone | Disciplines established |
| 9-10 | Exceptional | Approaching mastery |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Identify crisis areas** (1-4) for immediate intervention
2. **Choose 2-3 focus areas** for this season's growth
3. **Implement ONE small discipline** improvement per focus area
4. **Review weekly**, adjust monthly
5. **Re-assess quarterly**

### The Remediation Principle

If Discipline is weak, shore up Responsibility (are you taking ownership?).
Go down the layers until you find solid ground:

```
Discipline ← Responsibility ← Causality ← Order
```

## Visual: The Wheel

```
              Connection to God (1)
                      |
         Purpose (3)  |  Conscience (2)
              \       |       /
               \      |      /
    Health (9)--\-----|-----/--Mind (4)
                 \    |    /
                  \   |   /
    Capacity (8)---\--|--/---Will (5)
                    \ | /
         Fuel (7)----\|/----Emotions (6)
```

Plot each score (1-10) on its spoke. Connect the dots.

- **Balanced wheel** = sustainable life
- **Spiky wheel** = strengths but also crisis areas
- **Small wheel** = overall discipline gap
- **Lopsided wheel** = neglected domains

*"No dimension exists in isolation. Spirit, Soul, and Body affect each other. Neglect in one area will eventually impact others."*
