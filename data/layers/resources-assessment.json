    "relationship_to_skill": "Skill without resources is competence that isn't producing — you can do it well but it's not generating surplus.

Surplus should flow upward: use money surplus to buy back time; use time surplus to invest in relationships. Don't hoard at lower levels when you could be investing at higher ones."
